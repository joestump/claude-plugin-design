# claude-plugin-design

A Claude Code plugin for architecture decision records (ADRs), OpenSpec specifications, and Docusaurus documentation generation.

## Skills

| Skill | Invoke | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **ADR** | `/design:adr [description]` | Create an ADR using MADR format with team-based drafting and architect review |
| **OpenSpec** | `/design:openspec [capability]` | Create spec.md + design.md with RFC 2119 requirements and architect review |
| **Docs** | `/design:docs [project name]` | Scaffold a Docusaurus site from your ADRs and OpenSpecs |

## Install

Add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "design": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "joestump/claude-plugin-design"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Code. The plugin's skills will be available as `/design:adr`, `/design:openspec`, and `/design:docs`.

## What It Does

### `/design:adr` — Architecture Decision Records

Creates ADRs using [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format:
- Sequential numbering: `ADR-0001`, `ADR-0002`, etc.
- Stored in `docs/decisions/`
- Drafted and reviewed by a Claude Team (drafter + architect)
- YAML frontmatter with status, date, decision-makers

### `/design:openspec` — OpenSpec Specifications

Creates paired spec.md + design.md using [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec):
- Spec numbering: `SPEC-0001`, `SPEC-0002`, etc.
- Requirements in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) format (MUST, SHALL, MAY, etc.)
- Scenarios with `####` headings and WHEN/THEN format
- Stored in `openspec/specs/{capability-name}/`
- Drafted and reviewed by a Claude Team (spec-writer + architect)

### `/design:docs` — Docusaurus Documentation Site

Scaffolds a complete Docusaurus site that transforms your ADRs and specs into a polished doc site:
- RFC 2119 keyword highlighting (color-coded MUST/SHALL/MAY)
- Cross-reference linking (ADR-0001 and SPEC-NNN become clickable links)
- Status/Date/Domain badge components
- Requirement box components with anchor links
- Consequence keyword highlighting (Good/Bad/Neutral)
- Dark mode support
- Auto-generated sidebars

```

## Workflow

1. **Decide**: `/design:adr We need to choose a web framework for the admin dashboard`
2. **Review**: Read the ADR, discuss, mark `status: accepted`
3. **Specify**: `/design:openspec Convert ADR-0001 to a spec` (generates `SPEC-XXXX`)
4. **Document**: `/design:docs my-project`
5. **Develop**: `cd docs-site && npm run dev`

## CLAUDE.md Integration

After creating ADRs or specs, consider adding an Architecture Context section to your project's `CLAUDE.md` so future Claude sessions are aware of past decisions:

```markdown
## Architecture Context
- Architecture Decision Records are in `docs/decisions/`
- OpenSpec specifications are in `openspec/specs/`
```
