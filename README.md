# claude-plugin-design

A Claude Code plugin for architecture decision records (ADRs), specifications, and Docusaurus documentation generation.

## Skills

| Skill | Invoke | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **ADR** | `/design:adr [description] [--review]` | Create an ADR using MADR format with Mermaid diagrams |
| **Spec** | `/design:spec [capability] [--review]` | Create spec.md + design.md with RFC 2119 requirements and Mermaid diagrams |
| **Docs** | `/design:docs [project name]` | Scaffold a Docusaurus site from your ADRs and specs |
| **List** | `/design:list [adr\|spec\|all]` | List all ADRs and specs with their status |
| **Status** | `/design:status [ID] [status]` | Change the status of an ADR or spec |

## Install

Add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "design": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "joestump/claude-plugin-design"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Code. The plugin's skills will be available as `/design:adr`, `/design:spec`, `/design:docs`, `/design:list`, and `/design:status`.

## What It Does

### `/design:adr` -- Architecture Decision Records

Creates ADRs using [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format:
- Sequential numbering: `ADR-0001`, `ADR-0002`, etc.
- Stored in `docs/adrs/`
- Mermaid architecture diagrams included by default
- YAML frontmatter with status, date, decision-makers
- Single-agent by default; add `--review` for team-based drafting with architect review
- Offers to add an Architecture Context section to your CLAUDE.md on first use

### `/design:spec` -- Specifications

Creates paired spec.md + design.md using [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec):
- Spec numbering: `SPEC-0001`, `SPEC-0002`, etc.
- Requirements in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) format (MUST, SHALL, MAY, etc.)
- Scenarios with `####` headings and WHEN/THEN format
- Mermaid architecture diagrams required in design.md
- Stored in `docs/openspec/specs/{capability-name}/`
- Single-agent by default; add `--review` for team-based drafting with architect review

### `/design:docs` -- Docusaurus Documentation Site

Scaffolds a complete Docusaurus site that transforms your ADRs and specs into a polished doc site:
- Pre-flight checks (Node.js, existing content)
- RFC 2119 keyword highlighting (color-coded MUST/SHALL/MAY)
- Cross-reference linking (ADR-0001 and SPEC-NNN become clickable links)
- Mermaid diagram rendering
- Status/Date/Domain badge components
- Requirement box components with anchor links
- Consequence keyword highlighting (Good/Bad/Neutral)
- Dark mode support
- Auto-generated sidebars

### `/design:list` -- List Decisions and Specs

Lists all ADRs and specs with their status, date, and title. Filter by type with `adr`, `spec`, or `all`.

### `/design:status` -- Update Status

Changes the status of an ADR or spec. Valid statuses:
- **ADR**: proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded
- **Spec**: draft, review, approved, implemented, deprecated

## Project Structure

```

│   ├── adrs/                    # ADRs (created by /design:adr)
│   │   ├── ADR-0001-short-title.md
│   │   └── ADR-0002-short-title.md

└── docs-generated/              # Build artifact (generated by docs-site build)
```

## Workflow

1. **Decide**: `/design:adr We need to choose a web framework for the admin dashboard`
2. **Review**: `/design:list adr` to see all decisions, `/design:status ADR-0001 accepted` to approve
3. **Specify**: `/design:spec Convert ADR-0001 to a spec`
4. **Document**: `/design:docs my-project`
5. **Develop**: `cd docs-site && npm run dev`

For thorough team review on critical decisions, add `--review`:
- `/design:adr Choose a database --review`
- `/design:spec authentication-service --review`

## CLAUDE.md Integration

On first use, the ADR and spec skills offer to add an Architecture Context section to your project's CLAUDE.md so future Claude sessions are aware of past decisions:

```markdown
## Architecture Context
- Architecture Decision Records are in `docs/adrs/`
- Specifications are in `docs/openspec/specs/`
```
