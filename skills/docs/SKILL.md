# Generate Docusaurus Documentation Site

Scaffold a complete Docusaurus docs site that transforms ADRs from `docs/decisions/` and OpenSpec specs from `openspec/specs/` into a polished documentation website with:

- RFC 2119 keyword highlighting (MUST, SHALL, MAY, etc.)
- ADR cross-reference linking (ADR-0001 becomes a clickable link)
- RFC cross-reference linking (PREFIX-NNN links to spec requirement anchors)
- Status/Date/Domain badge components
- Requirement box components for spec tables
- Consequence keyword highlighting (Good/Bad/Neutral) in ADRs
- Gherkin keyword highlighting (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN) in specs
- Dark mode support
- Auto-generated sidebars

## Process

1. **Check for existing docs-site**: Look for `docs-site/` in the project root. If it exists, ask the user before overwriting.

2. **Read the plugin's Docusaurus templates** from the plugin's `templates/docusaurus/` directory. The plugin is installed at the path shown in the skill context. Read all template files from there.

3. **Scaffold `docs-site/`** by copying and adapting the templates:
   - Write `package.json` with project name from `$ARGUMENTS` or inferred from the repo
   - Write `docusaurus.config.ts` configured for this project (title, baseUrl, GitHub URL)
   - Write `sidebars.ts` with autogenerated sidebars for decisions and specs
   - Write all build scripts (`scripts/build-docs.js`, `transform-adrs.js`, `transform-openspecs.js`, `mdx-escape.js`, `build-rfc-mapping.js`)
   - Write all React components (`src/components/*.tsx`, `src/theme/MDXComponents.tsx`)
   - Write `src/css/custom.css` with all badge/keyword/component styles
   - Write `src/data/rfc-emojis.json` (empty `{}` to start, populated by build-rfc-mapping.js)
   - Write `tsconfig.json`

4. **Adapt paths**: The transform scripts need to know where ADRs and specs live relative to the docs-site. By default:
   - ADRs: `../docs/decisions/` (relative to docs-site)
   - OpenSpecs: `../openspec/specs/` (relative to docs-site)
   - Output: `../docs/` directory at project root

5. **Run the RFC mapping build** to populate `rfc-emojis.json` and `rfc-mapping.json` from existing specs.

6. **Run `npm install`** in the docs-site directory.

7. **Report** what was created and how to use it:
   - `cd docs-site && npm run dev` for development
   - `cd docs-site && npm run build` for production build
   - `cd docs-site && npm run build-content` to regenerate docs from ADRs/specs

## Key Template Files Reference

The templates directory contains production-ready versions of all files. When scaffolding:

### Transform Scripts (scripts/)
- `build-docs.js` — Orchestrator that runs all transforms
- `transform-adrs.js` — Transforms ADR markdown to .mdx with badges, RFC keyword highlighting, cross-references
- `transform-openspecs.js` — Transforms OpenSpec markdown to .mdx with requirement boxes, domain badges, RFC/Gherkin highlighting
- `mdx-escape.js` — Escapes MDX v3 unsafe patterns (curly braces, angle brackets) while preserving JSX components
- `build-rfc-mapping.js` — Scans specs for RFC ID prefixes and generates mapping JSON

### React Components (src/components/)
- `StatusBadge.tsx` — Status with emoji (accepted, proposed, draft, etc.)
- `DateBadge.tsx` — Date display with calendar emoji
- `DomainBadge.tsx` — Domain/category badge
- `PriorityBadge.tsx` — P0-P4 priority levels
- `SeverityBadge.tsx` — Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info
- `RFCLevelBadge.tsx` — Maps RFC keywords to severity colors
- `RequirementBox.tsx` — Bordered container for spec requirements with ID anchors
- `Field.tsx` / `FieldGroup.tsx` — Metadata label-value pairs
- `GherkinScenario.tsx` — Gherkin scenario display with tags
- `RfcNumber.tsx` — RFC reference with emoji and spec link

### Theme
- `src/theme/MDXComponents.tsx` — Registers all custom components for use in MDX
- `src/css/custom.css` — All badge, keyword, component, and dark mode styles

## Rules

- Always read templates from the plugin directory, don't recreate from memory
- Configure the Docusaurus site for the current project (title, URLs, etc.)
- The transform scripts must work with the project's actual directory structure
- Don't include OpenAPI plugin config unless the project has an OpenAPI spec
- Don't include regulations transforms unless the project uses Legal Gherkin
- Keep `rfc-emojis.json` and `rfc-mapping.json` as generated files (populated by build-rfc-mapping.js)
